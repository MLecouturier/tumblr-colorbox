===============

Introduction
------------

Creates a lightbox for images on your Tumblr blog using colorbox.js.


Usage
------------

Reference [http://29-steps-uk.github.com/tumblr-colorbox/javascripts/tumblr-colorbox.js](http://29-steps-uk.github.com/tumblr-colorbox/javascripts/tumblr-colorbox.js) inside your tumblr theme. You will need to edit the theme to do so


Motivation
-------------

Why recreate another lightbox script?

I did not like the way the tumblr js uses lightboxes for its photosets and I wanted to see how easy / difficult it would be to create a lightbox plugin using colorbox.js that could handle photo posts on
my own tumblr theme.

The code is partially based on http://picuous.github.com/tumblrbox/ where I got the first idea from.
